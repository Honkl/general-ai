# General AI Project
## About
General AI is a project where we try to develop a model which can be learned to play multiple games. The games
do not need to be similar in a term of gameplay - they can be vastly different. We are currently using four
games in this project:
* Alhambra (card board game)
* 2048 (simple sliding block puzzle)
* TORCS (car racing simulator)
* Mario (a well known arcade game)

For each game there must be specific interface implemented (in term of communication with AI).

## Project structure
### Controller
Contains the core of AI in Python.

### Game-interfaces
Interfaces for every game used. Either here or in a separate repository.
