# The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS)
TORCS is a highly portable multi platform car racing simulation. It is used as ordinary car racing game, as AI racing game and as research platform.

We will use TORCS as one game for our general AI project.

`race_config<port>.xml` files are torcs configuration files, each using specified port.

`torcs_starter.bat` is batch script that starts torcs. It's main 'connection' point between torcs and our AI. `torcs_starter_vis_on.bat` has same purpose but starts torcs visually.
