# Game 2048 interface
This game is simple to implement. We don't need to use any different processes or similar stuff which is used in Alhambra or TORCS.
File `game_2048.py` contains code of game core. Game itself is modified code from [tjwei](https://github.com/tjwei/2048-NN/blob/master/c2048.py). Game was first made in 2014, by [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).
